## How Users interact with claire

- Users interested in joining the engagement group can register with claire as members using the command `/start` and tapping on `register` button.

- Users can set social media handle to be liked. ex. `https://Instagram.com/r.e.e.c.h.e.e`

- Engagement Rounds are triggered at specific times; this is set by the Admin

- Members are notified about the start of a Round during a Drop Session; which is a few minutes/seconds before a round starts; they have a button option to `Join` the coming round or pass.

- Round starts immediately after Drop Session ends. Only Members who joined the round can participate in that Round.

- claire generates a list of all RoundParticipant's social media links i.e  `https://Instagram.com/allparticipantsprofiles`; shuffles the list and sends list to all RoundParticipants with instructions. 

- RoundParticipants are required to goto the links provided, like and comment on the last social media post of every other RoundParticipant on the list distributed. 

- All Members can be sent a warning by Admin if they fail to like and comment on other RoundParticipants posts or abide by any of the engagement rules set by Admin. Users are blocked from joining any round after three warnings and would need to send complaint to the Admin/support.

- Users can send complains to Admins using the command `/support followed by their complaint` e.g. `/support please reactivate my account`

- Users/Members do not need to interact with each other or the admin directly in any way, claire manages every action.

- Users/Members have access to a mini dashboard that displays number of warns they have and number of engagements they have been part of as well as the time of the next engagement using the command `/dashboard`, `/menu`. 


## How Admins interact with claire

- Admins can set specific times for engagement rounds to be triggered automatically during installation or setup this is a cron/repeating process Admins can also manually trigger a Round using the command "/round"-only an Admin can use this command.

- When a user fails to fulfill the above requirement he can be warned by the Admin with the command `/warn @username`, a user is blocked from joining rounds after three warn until freed.

- Admins can free users from blocks by taking their number of warns to zero with the command `/free @username`

- Admins would recieve all User complaints, questions and can send responses to the users by replying on the exact message that was sent by user.

- Admins can view all users and their number of warns with the command `/warn`

- Admin have Ultimate power and can `/delete` a user, block and unblock a user, warn a user, send warning messages to a user and set time for rounds to start.
